## üéØ Best Practices

### For Comprehensive Training
1. **Run during off-peak hours** to avoid interference
2. **Monitor system resources** during execution
3. **Validate data quality** after collection
4. **Archive results** for future reference

### For Development Testing
1. **Start with validation mode** to verify system health
2. **Use custom scenarios** for specific testing needs
3. **Monitor logs** for debugging issues
4. **Adjust concurrency** based on system capacity

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **HTTP Method "T" Errors**
   - Known issue with concurrent requests
   - Partial success expected (~70% success rate)
   - Does not affect RL training data quality

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Retry logic handles intermittent failures
   - Check user service health if persistent

3. **Service Timeouts**
   - Increase `request_timeout` in base config
   - Verify service capacity and health

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce `max_concurrent_users` if needed
   - Monitor system resources during execution

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Check service health
kubectl get pods -n ai-loadbalancer

# Test load balancer connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:8080/proxy/user-service/actuator/health

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods -n ai-loadbalancer
```
